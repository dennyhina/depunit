<!--
The root element of a DepUnit test xml file.  The verbose attribute is to specify
the amount of info that DepUnit prints out when running the unit tests.

<!ELEMENT suite (classGroup*,run+)>
	<!ATTLIST suite name CDATA #REQUIRED>
	<!ATTLIST suite verbose CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!--
The classGroup is used to group together classes that are commonly used 
throughout the different runs of the suite.  The name attribute can be
used to reference this group in the includeGroup tag.
-->
<!ELEMENT classGroup (class+)>
	<!ATTLIST classGroup name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!-- 
This represents a single run of tests.  The classes within a run are 
instanciated only once.
-->	
<!ELEMENT run (classes,tests?)>
	<!ATTLIST run name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!--
This is the classes that will be used durring the test run.
-->
<!ELEMENT classes (includeGroup?,class*)>

<!-- 
This references a classGroup that was previously defined.
-->
<!ELEMENT includeGroup (#PCDATA)>

<!-- 
This is a single class that is included in the run.  All methods of this class
that are defined by the Test annotation will be ran unless a test method is 
defined for the run.
-->
<!ELEMENT class (value*|driver)>
	<!ATTLIST class name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!-- 
The value element is used in several places and in all it represents property of
an object that is to be set.  The name attribute corrosponds to the property and
an appropriate set method will be called to set the value.  For example if the 
value is named StudentName a method setStudentName will be called on the object
to set the value.  Typical bean behavior.

<!ELEMENT value (#PCDATA)>
	<!ATTLIST value name CDATA #REQUIRED>

<!-- 
This element represents the data driver for a class.  The data driver can either
be inline or implemented in a seperate class.  If inline the driver element will 
have data sub elements.  The tests will be ran once for each data element.
Alternativly the name of a class can be provided in the class attribute that must
implement the DataDriver interface.
-->	
<!ELEMENT driver (data*|value*)>
	<!ATTLIST driver class CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- 
This element represents one set of data to be used for a run of tests.  The 
tests will be ran once for each data element.
-->
<!ELEMENT data (value+)>

<!-- 
This element is used to specify specific tests to be ran
-->
<!ELEMENT tests (method+)>

<!-- 
The method element is the full name of the test method to be ran.  If the test
has any hard dependencies, they will be ran firs in the appropriate order along
with any cleanup methods afterwords.
