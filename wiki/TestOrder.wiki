#summary What order will the tests run in.

=Test Ordering=

Without any dependencies defined DepUnit will run the tests in the order in which they show up in the class:
{{{
public class TestClass
  {
  @Test
  public void testOne()
    ...

  @Test
  public void testTwo()
    ...

  @Test
  public void testThree()
    ...
  }
}}}

The above tests will run in this order
  # testOne
  # testTwo
  # testThree

The order can be changed by adding hard or soft dependencies to each test.  Test ordering is very deterministic.
