}}}

The -r option is the name of the report file.  The default format of the report file is XML, this can be changed by specifying a XSL style sheet using the -s option.

The -s option is for specifying an XSL style sheet that will be applied to the report XML that is generated at the end of the test.  This lets you change the XML into HTML or some other suitable format for publishing.

The -x option lets you specify an XML test file that can contain one or more test runs.  Multiple -x options can be specified.

The -c option lets you specify a class to include in the test run.  Multiple -c options can be specified on the command line.  This option has no effect if the -x is used.

The "target methods" is used if you wish to only run a specific test out of the classes specified from the -c options.  This option has no effect if the -x is used.
